Tokenising:
-Input is taken through the file and scanned by each line
-Tokenised by taking the line and seperating the two values and placing them in to the vectors "from" and "to"
-"from" indicates the node and "to" indicates the directional value

Storage:
- Hashmap data structure is used to store the node objects, due to (o) complexity for adding and accessing nodes.
- Each object has essential properties for a pageRank: id, page score, page rank and a vector of its incoming and outgoing edges.

Computation:
- Start timer for run-time (started since tokenising until output)
- Computed iteratively by acessing each noeds using PageRank.
- Taxation and 'random-surfer- method is added to avoid dead-ends and spider-traps.
- After all calculation is done, results are stored in vector to be sorted by page score (HashMap cannot perform sorting).

Output includes:
- Run time
- Number of nodes
- Number of edges
- Number of iterations
- Beta value
